-- MAGIC **1. Which cohort shows the highest retention rate for each time threshold?**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **1 Month:
-- MAGIC **
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Highest retention is May 2024 cohort with 50.0%
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **2 Months:**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Highest retention is June 2024 cohort with 100.0%
-- MAGIC  (Note: June cohort size is only 10 customers, so small sample)
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **3 Months:**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Highest retention is May and June 2024 cohorts with 100.0%
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **2. Are there notable differences in short-term retention across cohorts?**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Yes, 1-month retention varies significantly from around 30% (March, June) to 50% (May).
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Earlier cohorts (Jan, Feb, Mar) have lower 1-month retention (~30-38%) compared to later cohorts (Apr, May) with 48-50%.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC At 2 and 3 months, retention rates generally increase for later cohorts, even reaching 100%, but note the sample size for the latest cohorts is small (10â€“16 customers).
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC This suggests improvement in retention for newer cohorts, especially after 1 month, but caution due to smaller cohort sizes.
