-- MAGIC **Step 3:** Combine the Results and Calculate the Days Between Purchases
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Join the two queries to produce a final result that includes the customerâ€™s first purchase date, second purchase date, and the number of days between these dates.

-- COMMAND ----------

    -- Step 1: Get the first purchase date for each customer

-- MAGIC **Step 4:** Save the Final Result as a New Table
-- MAGIC

-- MAGIC Create a new table (for example, cohort_analysis) in your Databricks database using the query result from Step 3.
