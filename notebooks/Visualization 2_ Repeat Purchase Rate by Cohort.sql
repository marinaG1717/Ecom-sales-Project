-- MAGIC ðŸ“ˆ **Observed Trends
-- MAGIC âœ… 2nd Order Rate:**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Very high across all cohorts (96%â€“100%)
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Indicates excellent short-term retention (almost everyone makes a second purchase)
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ðŸ“‰ 3rd Order Rate:
-- MAGIC Still strong (70%â€“98.5%), but gradually declines from Jan to Jun
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Sign of slight customer drop-off after 2nd order
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ðŸ“‰ 4th Order Rate:
-- MAGIC Clear downward trend from 83.3% (Jan) to 60% (Jun)
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Suggests long-term retention decreases for newer cohorts
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC **ðŸ“Œ Interpretation**
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Older cohorts (Janâ€“Mar) had better long-term engagement, with more customers making 3rd and 4th purchases.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Newer cohorts (Aprâ€“Jun) show weaker follow-up behavior, especially for 3rd/4th orders.
